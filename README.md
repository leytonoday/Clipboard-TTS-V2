Clipboard TTS version 2 is a complete re-write of the original, which was error prone and written in Vue.js and JavaScript. Version 2 is written using 
TypeScript and React, with Chakra-UI for the front end component library. 


Clipboard TTS is used to read your text aloud for you. It is a study tool to aid the dyslexic and mentally exhausted that are having trouble reading. 
As a student, it's often the case that you have a pile of books to read, and eventually it can be quite challenging and exhausting to get through it all. 
This is where this application comes in handy! It works by continuously scanning the clipboard for changes, and once the change is detected, it is read aloud. 


Note: As to not compromise quality of this application, I chose to use Google Cloud services. Clipboard TTS instructs you on how to acquire an API key and get the 
application setup.
